# Code Challenge - Exploring jQuery Selectors

In this challenge you will work in groups to practice using jquery to select different elements in the page using all of the different jQuery selectors aviable. 

## Steps

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork.
3. cd into the folder for this project.
4. open index.html in the browser and bring up the developer tools.
5. open this folder in your code editor.
6. In js/selectors.js and write the code neccesary to select 5 different elements from the index.html page and apply the class of `pinky` to them. Make use of the CSS selectors documented at the [link here](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/). You can use the addClass() method documented [here](http://api.jquery.com/addClass/), or wrap() method documented [here](http://api.jquery.com/wrap/) to apply the css class of `pinky` to selected elements. Don't forget to use the developer tools to explore elements relationships to each other and to find ways of selecting them.

Bonus: Use jQuery traversal methods to select one element and then switch selection to another element based on their location to each other in the DOM, documented at the [link here](http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/).
